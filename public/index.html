    <p>The goal is to train with digit recognition only in the middle of the grid and then see how it will be able to predict digit drawn near the side.</p>
    <p>Somehow this was not working, so I trained it with all possible possitions in the grid. I also tryed to show that it is possible not to have any number.</p>
    <p>But I am not happy with final results. It is not able to recognise digits very well. Also I don't understand hidden layers. In general it looks like the more you have the better it should be. But I can not find proper documentation about them to be
        able to understand how many neurons corresponding layers should have. Whay it is not possible to have an option that brain.js would create on his own multiple layers and decide on his own how many neurons it needs to have there. From my experementations,
        I got poor results - the more hidden layers I add, the wors it is able to understand the information.</p>
    <p>Suddenly I started to expierance another issue. When using pretrained data brain.js digit recognition shifted one step up, that means that when draw 0 it thinks that this is 1, when draw 2 it thinks that this is 3 and so on... Currently I turend off
        pretrained data sue to this.</p>
